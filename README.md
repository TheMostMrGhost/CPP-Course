# About
This repo contains assignments from C++ course at MIM UW 2023/2024.
Currently the instructions are in polish, but the code itself is in english.

# Running tests
To run tests, go to the chosen directory and run
```sh
chmod +x run_tests.sh
./run_tests
```
Optional flag `-v` (where available) turns on [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/) memory leak check.
**Important**: when using Valgrind, some tests take very long to run.

Tests were written by the course instructors, so they are designed to test the code toroughly.
